# JavaScript Calculator

An old project built in the first half of 2025 as the start of my journey and posted here to attach to the course's page and to preserve my path.

This project is a part of FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries Certification. The goal is to build a JavaScript Calculator that allows users to do simple arithmetic calculations.

## 📋 Project Requirements

This project fulfills all **15 user stories** from FreeCodeCamp's "Build a JavaScript Calculator" challenge:

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand the full requirements</b></summary>

<br>

**User Stories:**
- [x] Clickable `=` element with `id="equals"`
- [x] 10 clickable number elements (0-9) with IDs: `id="zero"` through `id="nine"`
- [x] 4 clickable operator elements with IDs: `id="add"`, `id="subtract"`, `id="multiply"`, `id="divide"`
- [x] Clickable decimal element with `id="decimal"`
- [x] Clickable clear element with `id="clear"`
- [x] Display element with `id="display"`
- [x] Clear button resets calculator to initialized state (shows `0`)
- [x] Input is visible in `#display` as numbers are entered
- [x] Can add, subtract, multiply, divide chain of numbers — `=` shows correct result
- [x] Numbers cannot begin with multiple zeros
- [x] Decimal appends `.` to current value; two decimals in one number not allowed
- [x] Operations work on numbers containing decimal points
- [x] Consecutive operators: last operator entered is used (excluding negative sign)
- [x] Operator immediately after `=` starts new calculation on previous result
- [x] Reasonable decimal precision (handles `2 / 7` to at least 4 decimal places)
